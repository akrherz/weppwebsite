                       COVERAGE DOCUMENTATION

COVERAGE NAME: COUNTY              DOCUMENTATION REVISION: 1/29/1993

DESCRIPTIVE NAME: State/County boundaries of the state of Iowa

STATUS: Complete

DESCRIPTION: This coverage contains polygons representing the county
  boundaries of the state of Iowa. COUNTY was developed from a set of
  99 individual coverages of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) for each
  county in the state. The PLSS coverages were digitized from paper copies
  of 7.5' topographic quadrangle maps. River boundaries were also digitized
  from 7.5' maps

ORIGINAL SOURCE INFORMATION:
  Media: Paper copies of 7.5' topographic quadrangle maps
  Title: Varies
  Author/Agency: U.S. Geological Survey
  Published Date: Varies
  Compiled Date: Varies
  Scale: 1:24,000
  Projection: Varies
  Geographic Control: Latitude/longitude tics at corners of 7.5' maps
  Data Conversion: Original map coordinate units were reprojected using
    in-house digitizing software to UTM units.
        
ACCURACY ASSESSMENT: Based on NMAS accuracy standards for USGS 1:24,000
  scale maps, digitizer resolution, ARC/INFO fuzzy tolerances, and 
  estimated operator error, the positional accuracy of this coverage is
  estimated to be around 22 meters.  Positional error was estimated using
  a root-sum-squared error calculation.


ASSOCIATED COVERAGES:
  Each county in the state has a coverage of PLSS asections digitized from
    7.5' topo quads. These are named using the first 8 characters in the
    county name.
  TOWNSHIP: This coverage has Iowa PLSS township boundaries developed
    from individual county PLSS section coverages.
  WCOUNTY: This is the same as COUNTY with vertices weeded to 500 meters.
    Used for plotting county outlines at small scales.
 
ASSOCIATED FILES:
  ADD_UTM: A dBASE application that uses PLSS section corner data to
    convert PLSS legal descriptions (up to 4 quarter sections) into
    UTM or latitude/longitude.

COMMENTS: Label points for polygons are placed at the locations of
  county seats.

    seat location

TICS: There are 167 tics placed at corners of county boundaries

Iowa Department of Natural Resources to carry out agency responsi- 
bilities related to management, protection, and development of Iowa's 
natural resources. It resides in the Natural Resources Geographic 
Information System library. Although efforts have been made to make it 
useful to the Department, the Department assumes no responsibility for
